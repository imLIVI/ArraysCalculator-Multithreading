# Working with threads
## ArraysCalculator-Multithreading
### Description
You need to write a program that calculates the sum and arithmetic mean of the array elements. You need to present a single-threaded and multithreaded solution, and 
also try to compare the execution time of both solutions. To begin with, generate a large integer array, and then try to make calculations for it in both modes, fixing 
the time. Try changing the number of array elements and evaluate how much more efficient it is to use parallel calculations on a large array and a drop in efficiency on
small arrays.

The functionality of the program:
1. Creating a filled array of integers.
2. Single-threaded calculation of the sum of array elements.
3. Multithreaded calculation of the sum of array elements.
